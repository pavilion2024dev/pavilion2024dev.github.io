			everywhere. In their practice, architectural elements, texts,
			drawings, paintings, sculptures, animations, sound, film, words, and
			scents play a significant role. Throughout the years, KOO has
			investigated and blurred the lines between their artwork and the
			space it occupies. The artwork adds new layers to any given space
			and KOO manages to merge small intimate experiences and large-scale
			immersive works.<br/> <br/>
			The curatorial approach for the Korean Pavilion 2024 has been to combine
			some of the key subjects and sculptural elements that KOO JEONG A has
			worked with during the last three decades. With the new commission
			<em>ODORAMA CITIES</em>, created especially for the Korean Pavilion,
			KOO delves into the nuances of our spatial encounters, investigating
			how we perceive and recollect spaces, with a particular emphasis on
			how scents, smells, and odors contribute to these memories. With the
			pavilion itself, KOO explores an expanded tactility.</div> <div>Some of the prominent interests in KOO’s art, such as immaterialism,
			weightlessness, endlessness, and levitation, are keywords throughout
			the Korean Pavilion. They are embedded and engraved as infinity
			symbols directly into the new wooden floor, manifested as two
			floating wooden möbius-shaped sculptures and a levitating,
			scent-diffusing bronze figure, and last but not least symbolized in
			the scents that transforms the pavilion into a collection of
			olfactory memories.<br/> <br/>
			These scent memories are a cornerstone in <em>ODORAMA CITIES</em>.
			During the summer of 2023, KOO collected them with the aim of making
			a scent portrait of the Korean peninsula. Through social media,
			advertisements, press releases, and personal one-on-one meetings,
			the team behind the Korean Pavilion has reached out to Koreans and
			non-Koreans – to anyone who has a relationship to Korea – and asked:
			“What is your scent memory of Korea?” This open call has generated
			more than 600 written statements about Korean scents. A perfumer,
			armed with the curated stories and keywords, took on the task of
			interpreting and incorporating them into the creation of 16 distinct
			scent experiences for the pavilion and a single commercial
			fragrance.</div></div>`,s;return t=new T({props:{title:"Exhibition"}}),{c(){u(t.$$.fragment),n=f(),a=g("div"),a.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(e){v(t.$$.fragment,e),n=w(e),a=y(e,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),O(a)!=="svelte-1xilwer"&&(a.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){b(a,"class","container")},m(e,i){K(t,e,i),r(e,n,i),r(e,a,i),s=!0},p:m,i(e){s||(_(t.$$.fragment,e),s=!0)},o(e){k(t.$$.fragment,e),s=!1},d(e){e&&(l(n),l(a)),x(t,e)}}}class P extends d{constructor(t){super(),p(this,t,null,$,h,{})}}export{P as E};
