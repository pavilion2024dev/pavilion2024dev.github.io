				KOO JEONG A (they/them, lives and works everywhere) has gained the
				attention of the international art world through their distinctive
				artistic practice of examining the fragile and ephemeral nature of
				objects and everyday lives to highlight their poetic mundaneness.
				KOO works across a diverse range of media—from scents, drawings,
				paintings, sculptures, installations, moving images, architectural
				projects, poetries, and fictions—and their delicate and detailed
				works question the boundaries between fact and fiction and the actuality
				and imaginary. KOO has made works that are seemingly casual and commonplace,
				yet at the same time remarkably precise, deliberate, and considered.
				Many of their works are conceived within site-specific environments
				that question the limits of fact and fiction, the imaginary and actuality
				of our world. KOO considers the connection of energies between a
				place and people, relying on chance to drive their encounters.<br/> <br/>
				KOO held solo shows at Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Germany (2012), Dia
				Art Foundation, Dia: Beacon, USA (2010), and Centre Pompidou, France
				(2004), where they gained their international stature. They have
				participated in various international exhibitions, including Venice
				Biennale, Italy (2014, 2009, 2003, 2001, 1995), Liverpool Biennale,
				UK (2010), Busan and Gwangju Biennales, South Korea (2020; 2014,
				2002, 1997), the Guggenheim Museum, USA (2010, 2004, 2002), Fondation
				Louis Vuitton, France (2015), and National Museum of Modern and Contemporary
				Art, South Korea (2015). KOO was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Prize
				in 2002, won the Hermes Korea Prize for contemporary art in 2005,
				and was named as 2016 Artist of the Year by the Korean Cultural Centre
				UK.<br/> <br/> <a href="https://www.koojeonga.com/" class="weak" target="_blank">→ WEBSITE</a>`,F,S,m,c,x,V,w,R="Courtesy of PKM Gallery. Photo by Kim Je Won.",G,f,y,j=`<strong>ARTISTIC DIRECTORS</strong><br/>
